## 📊 Key Metrics & Visuals
- `StockoutCount`: SKUs below safety stock
- `SalesAnomalyCount`: SKUs with sales < 50% of rolling average
- `InventoryRiskScore`: High / Medium / Low / Stable classification
- `ForecastStatus`: Forecasted Stockout vs Sufficient
- Line chart: `Units_Sold` vs `RollingAvgUnitsSold` over time
- Risk heatmap: SKU-level risk across stores or categories
